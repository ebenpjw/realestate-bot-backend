ORDER BY price_min ASC
```

## üí° Bot Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Detailed Unit Information
```
Lead: "Tell me about the 3-bedroom units"
Bot: "The 3-bedroom units are 980 sqft and priced from $2.44M to $2.48M. That works out to about $2,490 per sqft. Currently, 2 out of 4 units are still available (50% availability). Would you like to see the floor plans?"
```

### Example 2: Comparative Analysis
```
Lead: "What's the difference between regular and deluxe 3-bedroom?"
Bot: "Great question! The regular 3-bedroom is 980 sqft ($2.44M-$2.48M), while the 3-bedroom deluxe is 1023 sqft ($2.50M-$2.55M). The deluxe gives you 43 sqft more space for about $60K-$70K more. The deluxe also has better availability with 3 out of 5 units still available."
```

### Example 3: Budget Optimization
```
Lead: "I have a $2.5M budget"
Bot: "Perfect! With $2.5M, you can get the 3-bedroom deluxe units (1023 sqft) starting from exactly $2.50M. You could also consider the regular 3-bedroom (980 sqft) from $2.44M-$2.48M, which would save you some budget. Both have good availability right now."
