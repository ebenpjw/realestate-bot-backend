# Railway Deployment Fix ðŸš€

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **NPM Cache Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Railway was experiencing cache corruption during `npm ci`
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `nixpacks.toml` to clean cache before install
  - Added `.npmrc` with production-optimized settings
  - Removed conflicting build commands between `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml`

### 2. **Node.js Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: `nixpacks.toml` specified Node.js 22 but `package.json` required >=18
- **Solution**: Aligned both to use Node.js 20 for stability

### 3. **Build Command Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Both `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` were running npm install commands
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate commands, let Nixpacks handle the build process

## Files Modified

### 1. `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs_20', 'npm-10_x']  # Updated from nodejs_22

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  'npm cache clean --force',           # Clean cache first
  'rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json',  # Fresh start
  'npm install --production --no-cache --prefer-offline'  # Optimized install
]
```

### 2. `railway.json`
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"  # Removed conflicting buildCommand
  }
}
```

### 3. `package.json`
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0",    # Updated from >=18.0.0
    "npm": ">=10.0.0"      # Updated from >=8.0.0
  }
}
```

### 4. `.npmrc` (New File)
- Optimized npm settings for Railway deployment
- Disabled package-lock generation during CI
- Set production optimizations

### 5. `scripts/railway-deploy.js` (New File)
- Pre-deployment environment check
- Validates required environment variables
- Checks package.json configuration

## Next Steps

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment cache issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Monitor Railway Deployment**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Watch the build logs - you should see:
   - Cache cleaning process
   - Fresh npm install
   - Successful build completion

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
After successful deployment, check:
- Health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Application logs in Railway dashboard
- All environment variables are properly set

### 4. **Run Deployment Check (Optional)**
Before deploying, you can run locally:
```bash
npm run deploy-check
```

## Expected Build Process

With these fixes, Railway will now:
1. âœ… Use Node.js 20 and npm 10
2. âœ… Clean npm cache completely
3. âœ… Remove old node_modules and package-lock.json
4. âœ… Install dependencies fresh with production optimizations
5. âœ… Run build and validation
6. âœ… Start the application

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear Railway Build Cache**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Clear Build Cache

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required variables are set in Railway
   - Run `npm run deploy-check` locally to verify

3. **Monitor Build Logs**:
   - Watch for any remaining cache or permission errors
   - Look for successful npm install completion

## Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- âœ… `NODE_ENV=production`
- âœ… `SUPABASE_URL`
- âœ… `SUPABASE_KEY`
- âœ… `GUPSHUP_API_KEY`
- âœ… `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- âœ… `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`
- âœ… All other variables from `.env.example`

The deployment should now work successfully! ðŸŽ‰
