# Railway Deployment Fix ðŸš€

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Nixpacks Package Error**
- **Problem**: `npm-10_x` is not a valid Nixpacks package name
- **Solution**: Switched from Nixpacks to Docker for more reliable builds

### 2. **NPM Cache Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Railway was experiencing cache corruption during `npm ci`
- **Solution**:
  - Created custom Dockerfile with proper cache cleaning
  - Added `.npmrc` with production-optimized settings
  - Added preinstall script to clean cache

### 3. **Build Reliability**
- **Problem**: Nixpacks was causing inconsistent builds
- **Solution**: Using Docker provides more predictable and reliable builds

## Files Modified

### 1. `Dockerfile` (New File)
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm cache clean --force && \
    npm install --production --no-optional --no-audit --no-fund
COPY . .
# Security and health check setup
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 2. `railway.json`
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",        # Switched from NIXPACKS
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"  # Use custom Dockerfile
  }
}
```

### 3. `package.json`
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x",        # Specific Node.js 20
    "npm": ">=9.0.0"       # Compatible npm version
  },
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npm cache clean --force || true"  # Clean cache before install
  }
}
```

### 4. `.npmrc` (Updated)
- Optimized npm settings for Railway deployment
- Removed problematic settings that caused conflicts
- Set production optimizations

### 5. `scripts/railway-deploy.js` (New File)
- Pre-deployment environment check
- Validates required environment variables
- Checks package.json configuration

### 6. Removed `nixpacks.toml`
- Eliminated the source of package name conflicts
- Docker provides more reliable builds

## Next Steps

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment cache issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Monitor Railway Deployment**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Watch the build logs - you should see:
   - Cache cleaning process
   - Fresh npm install
   - Successful build completion

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
After successful deployment, check:
- Health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Application logs in Railway dashboard
- All environment variables are properly set

### 4. **Run Deployment Check (Optional)**
Before deploying, you can run locally:
```bash
npm run deploy-check
```

## Expected Build Process

With these fixes, Railway will now:
1. âœ… Use Docker with Node.js 20 Alpine (lightweight and fast)
2. âœ… Clean npm cache before installation
3. âœ… Install production dependencies only
4. âœ… Run build and validation
5. âœ… Start the application with proper health checks
6. âœ… Use non-root user for security

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear Railway Build Cache**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Clear Build Cache

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required variables are set in Railway
   - Run `npm run deploy-check` locally to verify

3. **Monitor Build Logs**:
   - Watch for any remaining cache or permission errors
   - Look for successful npm install completion

## Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- âœ… `NODE_ENV=production`
- âœ… `SUPABASE_URL`
- âœ… `SUPABASE_KEY`
- âœ… `GUPSHUP_API_KEY`
- âœ… `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- âœ… `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`
- âœ… All other variables from `.env.example`

The deployment should now work successfully! ðŸŽ‰
