## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Smart Appointment Intent Detection**

"Can we do 3pm today?" → ✅ Books appointment
"I want to speak to consultant" → ❌ Asks for time preference
```

### **2. Enhanced Calendar Integration**
```javascript
// Double validation prevents invalid slots
const isAvailable = await isTimeSlotAvailable(agentId, slot);
if (!isAvailable) {
  logger.warn('Slot failed validation - filtering out');
}
```

### **3. Natural Conversation Flow**
```javascript
// Multiple messages with natural delays
{
  "message1": "Sure, can set up a call for you.",
  "message2": "When would work for you?",
  "message3": "We do it over Zoom, so quite convenient."
}
```

### **4. Strategic Persuasion**
```javascript
// Natural scare tactics woven into conversation
"Most first-time buyers end up overpaying quite a bit"
"The consultants have saved clients from some costly mistakes"
"Going solo means you might miss out on off-market deals"
```

### **5. Zoom Consultation Positioning**
```javascript
// Low-pressure, convenient positioning
"We do it over Zoom, so quite convenient"
"Usually takes about 30-60 minutes"  
"If it's not helpful, you can just leave the call"
```
