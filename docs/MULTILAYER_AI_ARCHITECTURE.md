  - `conversionPriority`: low|medium|high|urgent

#### Layer 4: Content Generation & Personalization
- **Purpose**: Generate actual response content following Layer 3 strategy
- **Input**: All previous layer results
- **AI Model**: GPT-4.1 with Doro personality prompts
- **Output**: Draft response content with media attachments
- **Features**:
  - Personalized language and tone
  - WhatsApp formatting (\\n\\n for line breaks)
  - Floor plan image preparation
  - Cultural appropriateness for Singapore market

#### Layer 5: Synthesis & Quality Validation
- **Purpose**: Cross-reference all layers and validate response quality
- **Input**: All previous layer results
- **AI Model**: GPT-4.1 with quality validation prompts

- **Key Features**:
  - Quality scoring (0.0-1.0)
  - Fact-check validation
  - Cultural appropriateness check
  - Consultant briefing generation
  - Lead updates extraction

### 2. Property Data Integration

#### Database Integration
- **Source**: Supabase property_projects table with visual_assets
- **Search Criteria**: District, property type, price range, bedroom count
- **Data Fields**: Project name, developer, pricing, availability, floor plans

#### Fact-Checking System
- **Method**: Google Custom Search API with property-specific queries
- **Verification**: Price accuracy, developer verification, launch dates
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 based on search result analysis
- **Trusted Sources**: PropertyGuru, 99.co, EdgeProp, Straits Times

#### Floor Plan Delivery
- **Process**: 
  1. Temporary download from stored URLs
  2. Image validation (size, format, content)
  3. WhatsApp delivery with AI-generated captions
  4. Immediate cleanup of local files
- **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP (max 5MB)
- **AI Analysis**: Room count, layout type, square footage

### 3. Appointment Booking Integration

#### Intelligent Scheduling
- **Availability Check**: Google Calendar integration
- **Slot Finding**: Next available 1-hour slot within 7 days
- **Conflict Detection**: Existing appointments and blocked time
- **Booking Process**: Atomic transaction with rollback capability

#### Consultant Briefing System
- **Lead Psychology**: Communication style, resistance patterns, urgency
- **Requirements**: Budget, intent, preferences, timeline
- **Recommended Properties**: Top 3 matches with verification status
- **Conversation Strategy**: Approach, objection handling, trust building
- **Conversion Notes**: Appointment readiness and focus areas

#### Integration Points
- **Google Calendar**: Event creation with Zoom links
- **Zoom API**: Meeting generation with consultant details
- **WhatsApp**: Confirmation messages with meeting details
- **Database**: Appointment tracking and lead updates

### 4. Performance Monitoring & Fallback Systems

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Layer Metrics**: Processing time, success rate, failure patterns
- **Business Metrics**: Conversion rate, fact-check accuracy, lead qualification
- **Health Checks**: Automated every 60 seconds
- **Alert System**: Severity-based notifications (critical, high, medium, low)

#### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Layer Failures**: Individual layer fallbacks with simplified processing
- **System Failures**: Automatic fallback to original botService
- **Performance Degradation**: Automatic fallback triggers
- **Thresholds**:
  - Max processing time: 30 seconds
  - Min success rate: 80%
  - Max fallback rate: 20%
  - Min fact-check accuracy: 70%
