# 6-Hour Follow-up System for New Leads

## Overview

The 6-hour follow-up system automatically sends a gentle follow-up message to new leads who don't respond to the initial welcome message within 6 hours. This system is designed to catch leads who might have missed the initial message or need a gentle nudge, while respecting PDPA compliance laws in Singapore.

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ **PDPA Compliant**
- Only sends messages between 9 AM - 9 PM Singapore time
- Respects business hours and privacy regulations
- Automatically adjusts timing to comply with regulations

### ‚úÖ **One-Time Follow-up**
- Sends only ONE follow-up message per lead
- Only triggers within the first 24-hour window
- Uses free-form messages (not templates) since it's within 24 hours

### ‚úÖ **Smart Detection**
- Automatically tracks when intro messages are sent to new leads
- Detects when leads respond and cancels pending follow-ups
- Only tracks leads created within the last 5 minutes (truly new leads)

### ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant Support**
- Works with agent-specific WABA configurations
- Integrates with existing multi-tenant architecture
- Supports both legacy and multi-tenant modes

## How It Works

### 1. **Intro Message Tracking**
When a welcome template is sent to a new lead:
```javascript
// Automatically called when sending welcome templates
await newLeadFollowUpService.trackIntroMessageSent(
  leadId,
  phoneNumber, 
  agentId
);
```

### 2. **PDPA Compliant Scheduling**
The system calculates follow-up time respecting business hours:
- **If 6 hours later falls between 9 AM - 9 PM**: Schedule normally
- **If 6 hours later is before 9 AM**: Schedule for 9 AM same day
- **If 6 hours later is after 9 PM**: Schedule for 9 AM next day

### 3. **Lead Response Detection**
When a lead responds to any message:
```javascript
// Automatically called when processing lead messages
await newLeadFollowUpService.markLeadResponded(leadId);
```

### 4. **Automated Processing**
- Runs every 10 minutes via scheduler
- Only processes during business hours (9 AM - 9 PM Singapore)
- Sends contextual follow-up messages

## Follow-up Message Examples

The system generates varied, contextual messages:

```
"Hi John! üòä Just wanted to make sure you saw my earlier message. I'm here to help with any property questions you might have!"

"Hey Sarah! Hope you're doing well. Did you get a chance to see my message earlier? Happy to help with your property search! üòä"

"Hi Michael! üòä Following up on my earlier message - I know WhatsApp can be busy sometimes. I'm here whenever you're ready to chat about properties!"
```

## Database Schema

### `new_lead_intro_tracking` Table
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- lead_id: UUID (References leads table)
- phone_number: VARCHAR(20)
- agent_id: UUID (References agents table)
- conversation_id: UUID (Optional)
- intro_sent_at: TIMESTAMP (When intro was sent)
- follow_up_due_at: TIMESTAMP (When follow-up should be sent)
- follow_up_sent_at: TIMESTAMP (When follow-up was sent)
- responded_at: TIMESTAMP (When lead responded)
- status: VARCHAR(20) (pending, responded, follow_up_sent, failed)
- error_message: TEXT (If failed)
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Template Service**
- `templateService.js` automatically tracks intro messages
- Hooks into both `sendWelcomeTemplate()` and `sendAgentWelcomeTemplate()`

### 2. **Bot Service**
- `botService.js` automatically marks leads as responded
- Integrates with existing `_handleLeadResponseForFollowUp()` method

### 3. **Scheduler**
- `followUpScheduler.js` processes follow-ups every 10 minutes
- Respects business hours and PDPA compliance

## Configuration

### PDPA Compliance Settings
```javascript
COMPLIANCE_SETTINGS: {
  ALLOWED_HOURS: {
    START: 9, // 9 AM
    END: 21   // 9 PM
  },
  TIMEZONE: 'Asia/Singapore'
}
```

## Monitoring & Statistics

### Get System Statistics
```javascript
const stats = await newLeadFollowUpService.getStatistics();
// Returns: total, pending, responded, follow_up_sent, failed, response_rate
```

### Example Statistics Output
```
6-Hour Follow-up Statistics (Last 7 days):
- Total tracked: 45
- Pending: 3
- Responded: 28
- Follow-ups sent: 12
- Failed: 2
- Response rate: 62.2%
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify system functionality:
```bash
node test_6_hour_followup.js
```

The test verifies:
- ‚úÖ PDPA compliance timing
- ‚úÖ Statistics retrieval
- ‚úÖ Pending follow-up processing
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity
- ‚úÖ System health

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `services/newLeadFollowUpService.js` - Main service
- `database/migrations/add_new_lead_intro_tracking.sql` - Database schema
- `test_6_hour_followup.js` - Test script
- `run_migration.js` - Migration runner

### Modified Files
- `services/templateService.js` - Added intro tracking
- `services/botService.js` - Added response detection
- `services/followUpScheduler.js` - Added scheduled processing

## Production Deployment

1. **Run Migration**: Execute the SQL migration to create the tracking table
2. **Deploy Code**: Deploy the updated services
3. **Monitor**: Use the test script and statistics to monitor performance
4. **Verify**: Ensure PDPA compliance is working correctly

## Benefits

- **üéØ Improved Lead Engagement**: Catches leads who missed initial message
- **üì± Better Response Rates**: Gentle nudge increases conversation starts
- **‚öñÔ∏è PDPA Compliant**: Respects Singapore privacy laws
- **ü§ñ Fully Automated**: No manual intervention required
- **üìä Trackable**: Full statistics and monitoring
- **üîÑ Smart**: Only sends when needed, cancels when lead responds

The system is now ready for production use and will help improve lead engagement while maintaining full compliance with Singapore's PDPA regulations! üöÄ
