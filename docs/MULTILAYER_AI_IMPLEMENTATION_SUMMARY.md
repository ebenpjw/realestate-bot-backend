## üîç Key Features Implemented

### Google Custom Search API Fact-Checking
- **Real-time verification** of property prices, launch dates, developer information
- **Confidence scoring** (0.0-1.0) based on search result analysis
- **Trusted sources** prioritization (PropertyGuru, 99.co, EdgeProp, Straits Times)
- **Automatic fallback** to database data if fact-checking fails

### On-Demand Floor Plan Delivery
- **Temporary download** from stored URLs (max 5MB, JPG/PNG/WebP)
- **AI-generated captions** with room count, square footage, layout type
- **WhatsApp delivery** with immediate file cleanup
- **Batch processing** with rate limiting protection

### Intelligent Appointment Booking
- **Google Calendar integration** for availability checking
- **Automatic slot finding** within next 7 days during business hours
- **Consultant briefing generation** with lead psychology, requirements, and strategy
- **Zoom meeting creation** with calendar event integration

### Performance Monitoring & Fallback
- **Real-time monitoring** of layer success rates and processing times
- **Automatic fallback** to original botService if system degrades
- **Alert system** with severity levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Health checks** every 60 seconds with performance thresholds

## üö® Critical Conflicts Identified & Resolved

### 1. Message Length Restrictions (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: `responseSynthesizer.js` capped responses to 400-600 characters
- **Impact**: Severely constrained strategic thinking capabilities
- **Resolution**: Removed all character limits from internal AI processing layers

### 2. Competing Processing Systems (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Dual processing paths (old unifiedProcessor vs new multiLayerAI)
- **Impact**: Conflicts and inefficiencies in message handling
- **Resolution**: Disabled old system, ensured clean integration

### 3. Inconsistent OpenAI Configuration (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Different temperature/token settings across files
- **Impact**: Unpredictable AI behavior
- **Resolution**: Standardized configuration for multi-layer system
