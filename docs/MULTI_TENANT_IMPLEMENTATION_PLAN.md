# Multi-Tenant Real Estate Bot Implementation Plan

**Project:** Multi-Agent WABA Architecture Implementation  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 by Anthropic (Augment Agent)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for transforming the current single-tenant real estate bot into a multi-tenant system supporting multiple agents with individual WABA setups, while maintaining unified bot effectiveness and implementing robust lead deduplication.

## 1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Existing Architecture
- **Single-tenant system** with hardcoded WABA credentials
- **Centralized configuration** in environment variables
- **Simple lead management** with basic agent assignment
- **Unified bot personality** across all interactions
- **No lead deduplication** across agents

### 1.2 Key Limitations Identified
- WABA credentials hardcoded in `config.js` and `whatsappService.js`
- Template management centralized in `templateService.js`
- Lead assignment to single default agent
- No conversation isolation between agents
- No cross-agent lead tracking

## 2. TARGET ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Multi-Tenant Database Schema
- **Organizations table** for top-level tenant isolation
- **Enhanced agents table** with WABA configuration
- **WABA templates table** for agent-specific templates
- **Global leads table** for deduplication
- **Agent conversation threads** for isolation
- **Enhanced message tracking** with conversation context

### 2.2 Service Architecture
- **Multi-Tenant Config Service** for dynamic credential management
- **Lead Deduplication Service** for cross-agent lead tracking
- **Enhanced WhatsApp Service** with agent-specific routing
- **Dynamic Template Service** with agent-specific templates
- **Conversation Isolation** maintaining separate threads per agent

INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug) VALUES ('Default Organization', 'default');

-- Step 2: Migrate existing agents to new schema
UPDATE agents SET organization_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'default');

-- Step 3: Migrate existing leads to global leads table
INSERT INTO global_leads (phone_number, full_name, first_contact_source, first_contact_agent_id)
SELECT DISTINCT phone_number, full_name, source, assigned_agent_id FROM leads;

-- Step 4: Create agent conversations from existing leads
INSERT INTO agent_lead_conversations (global_lead_id, agent_id, conversation_status, ...)
SELECT gl.id, l.assigned_agent_id, l.status, ... FROM leads l
JOIN global_leads gl ON l.phone_number = gl.phone_number;

## 4. MIGRATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Zero-Downtime Migration Approach
1. **Parallel Schema Deployment**
   - Deploy new schema alongside existing tables
   - Use database views for backward compatibility
   - Implement dual-write pattern during transition

2. **Gradual Service Migration**
   - Deploy new services with feature flags
   - Route percentage of traffic to new system
   - Monitor performance and rollback if needed

3. **Data Consistency Validation**
   - Implement data validation scripts
   - Compare old vs new system outputs
   - Ensure message delivery consistency

### 4.2 Rollback Strategy
- Maintain existing tables during migration
- Implement service rollback switches
- Prepare data rollback procedures
- Monitor system health metrics

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

### 5.1 Multi-Agent Test Scenarios
1. **Same Lead, Multiple Agents**
   - Lead contacts Agent A via Facebook ad
   - Same lead contacts Agent B via Instagram ad
   - Verify separate conversation threads
   - Validate lead deduplication tracking

2. **Agent-Specific Customization**
   - Test different bot names per agent
   - Validate custom responses per agent
   - Verify WABA-specific templates
   - Test working hours per agent

3. **Cross-Agent Lead Intelligence**
   - Verify lead profile aggregation
   - Test cross-agent interaction history
   - Validate attribution reporting
   - Test conversion tracking per agent

### 5.2 Compliance Testing
- WABA template compliance per agent
- Message delivery tracking per WABA
- Rate limiting per agent
- Audit trail per organization

## 6. RISK MITIGATION

### 6.1 Technical Risks
- **Database Migration Complexity**
  - Mitigation: Extensive testing in staging environment
  - Rollback: Maintain parallel systems during transition

- **Performance Degradation**
  - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimize queries
  - Monitoring: Real-time performance metrics
